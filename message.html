            A Message From Warren E. Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
            Dear Reader,
          </p>

          <p>
            You probably know that I don't make stock recommendations. However,
            I have two thoughts regarding your personal expenditures that can
            save you real money. I'm suggesting that you call on the services of
            two subsidiaries of Berkshire: GEICO and Borsheim's.
          </p>

          <p>
            I estimate that about 40% of all auto drivers in the country can
            save money by insuring with GEICO. The figure is not 100% because
            insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with some favoring
            drivers who live in certain geographical areas and work in certain
            occupations more than GEICO does. I believe, however, that GEICO
            more frequently offers the low price than does any other national
            carrier selling insurance to all comers. You can quickly find out
            whether you can save money by going to www.geico.com or by calling
            800-555-2756.
          </p>

            Fine jewelry, watches and giftware will almost certainly cost you
            less at Borsheim's. I've looked at the figures for all
            publicly-owned jewelry companies and the contrast with Borsheim's is
            startling. Our one-store operation, with its huge volume, enables us
            to operate with costs that are fully 15-20 percentage points below
            those incurred by our competitors. We pass the benefits of this
            low-cost structure along to our customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every year Borsheim's sends out thousands of selections to customers
            who want a long-distance opportunity to inspect what it offers and
            decide which, if any, item they'd like to purchase. We do a huge
            amount of business in this low-key way, which allows the shopper to
            conveniently see the exceptional values that we offer. Call Sean
            Moore or Karen Goracke at Borsheim's (800-642-4438) and save
            substantial money on your next purchase of jewelry.
          </p>

          <p>Sincerely</p>
          <p>Warren E. Buffett</p>
